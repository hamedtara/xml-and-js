1. Open `module-2/assignments/assignment.xml` in your browser. Are there any errors? Explain the error and fix it. 3 errors:

1.1- Attribute name "Date" associated with an element type "effective" must be followed by the ' = ' character.
the problem is that we should use declare date type correctly like this :
<effectiveDate>03/12/2016</effectiveDate>

1.2- The element type "originalName" must be terminated by the matching end-tag "</originalName>"

The problem is that we should use exactly the tag name like this :
<originalName> Fresh Mornin' Sampler </originalName>

1.3-The element type "name" must be terminated by the matching end-tag "</name>".

It should be like this:
<name> Oatmeal Breakfast</name>
